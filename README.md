____________________________________________________________


Created this application using HTML, CSS for styling details and JavaScript for user interactions. 

Retrieved the necessary currency conversion rates from a RESTful API (https://exchangeratesapi.io/) in order to get updated rates.

Due to the sheer amount of international currencies, I only selected 14 of the most widely used and important currencies.

1. Canadian Dollar

2. US Dollar

3. Euro

4. Japanese Yen

5. Australian Dollar

6. Chinese Yuan

7. Swiss Franc

8. Hong Kong Dollar

9. Swedish Krona

10. South Korean Won

11. Singapore Dollar

12. Indian Rupee

13. Russian Rubble

14. Thai Bhat

Once you open the HTML file, you will be brought to this screen:

The initially showcased currencies are Canadian Dollar, US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. The base currency is Canadian Dollar but it can be changed once you enter a number into the other currencies' input box.

For each currency, you have the country's flag, the currency's symbol, the currency's name and the currency's conversion rate to the base currency.

If you wish to remove some currencies, you can click on the "x" button. If you wish to add currencies to the screen, you can click the "Add Currencies" button and proceed to click the currencies you wish to view. The currencies that are already selected will be greyed out and no longer clickable.
